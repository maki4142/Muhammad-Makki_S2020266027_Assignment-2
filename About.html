<p> 
    Coffea Arabica is descended from the original coffee trees discovered in Ethiopia.  
    These trees produce a fine, mild, aromatic coffee and represent approximately 70% of the world's coffee production.
    The beans are flatter and more elongated <br> than Robusta and lower in caffeine.
     On the world market, Arabica coffees bring the highest prices.  
     The better Arabicas are high grown coffees — generally grown between 2,000 to 6,000 feet (610 to 1830 meters) above sea level
     though<br> optimal altitude varies with proximity to the equator.
     The most important factor is that temperatures must remain mild,ideally between 59 - 75 degrees Fahrenheit,
     with about 60 inches of rainfall a year. The trees are hearty, but a heavy<br> world's Robusta is grown in Central and Western Africa, 
     and in Brazil. Production of Robusta is increasing, though it accounts for only about 30% of the world market.
     Robusta is 60 inches of rainfall a year,and cannot withstand frost. Compared with Arabica, Robusta beans produce a coffee which has a distinctive taste and about 50-60% more 
     caffeine.
